The student's answer should be well written as though it were a recommendation to a client. It must consider varying parameters such as document length, n-gram size, and number of documents per request. We don't need them to follow any specific procedure, so as long as they present a clear range and their procedure seems to consider multiple possible variables, it is acceptable. Be reasonable here. We aren't looking for an incredibly in-depth answer as long as it is clear that the student understands the basics of load testing.
