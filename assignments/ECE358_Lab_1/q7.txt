## Question: **Recommend a safe maximum load** for the current system with the above memory restrictions. Use your simulator and perform experiments varying the document length, number of documents per query, and size of n-grams. Justify your answer. We are ultimately looking for a range of values that the client can use to monitor server load. The idea is that if the client ever sees loads approaching this maximum safe load, they should start to consider increasing server capacity.

In this part, imagine you are answering these questions from the client. Justify your answers well - the client is going to be relying on your report to scale their infrastructure, so if you just say "100 requests per second" or something without any more explanation they will probably not believe you!
