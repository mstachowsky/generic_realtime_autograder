We are looking for well-justified, numerical answers. The student should show evidence that they investigated the maximum number and should make some mention of the number of docuents and their length. The experiments should have been run several times to account for the stochastic nature of the problem. The students do not need to provide any relationship between the variables and the maximum number, but it must at least be clear that they considered these variables in their experiments.
