## Question: Reflect on real-world trade-offs: The current architecture uses a single server to process all requests. We can increase capacity in several ways - perhaps we simply buy a bigger server, use multiple servers and load balancing etc. Briefly reflect on the tradeoffs that the client will have to consider as they expand their system to accommodate more users. Other than total number of users that can be serviced, are there other things to consider while scaling the system? How does this impact the tradeoff analysis?
