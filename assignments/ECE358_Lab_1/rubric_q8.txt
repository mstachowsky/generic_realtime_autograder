Students were tasked with exploring infrastructure purchases based on expected server load. Their answer to this question should discuss different tradeoffs that an organization would make as they seek to expand their system. Cost should definitely be mentioned, but there are many ways to answer this question. As long as the student has considered 2-3 good ideas and explains their impacts well (maybe at least 2-3 sentences each) the student meets expectations.
