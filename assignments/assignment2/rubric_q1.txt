The student must show the correct quadratic formula. Be generous with formatting, it may be in proper LaTeX or just plaintext, but the math must be correct. Be sure to enforce rigor - the student must show the entire, complete quadratic formula to be correct. Any errors should be noted and do not meet expectations. The student must show their work properly and thoroughly. Derivations are expected.
